# Simple Bank Transactions [C#]
My Project for Diploma Plus (minor) in Software Programming. Written in C#.
 
This project simulates a simplified version of bank processes. It allows customer creation, deposit, withdrawl, and bank transfer.
 
During my studies in Singapore Polytechnic, I took a Diploma Plus (similar to a minor) in Software Programming for Application. This project was for one of the 4 modules I had to take and it is written in C#.
